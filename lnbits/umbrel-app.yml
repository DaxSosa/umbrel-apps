description: >-
  LNbits is a simple multi-user and account system for Lightning
  Network that can be used for creating separate Lightning wallets for friends
  and family members. You can also create multiple accounts for yourself to
  mitigate the risk of exposing applications to your full balance via unique API
  keys for each wallet.


  LNbits is packaged with tools to help manage funds, such as a table of transactions, line chart of spending, export to CSV, and more to come. It provides an extendable platform for expanding Lightning Network functionality via LNbits extension framework, and can also be used as a fallback wallet for the LNURL scheme.


  HOW TO INSTALL EXTENSIONS:
  Extensions can be installed by visiting the super admin page of your LNbits app. To do this, open your LNbits app
  and replace the umbrel.local:3007 URL with umbrel.local:3007/uuidv4/<your-unique-password-shown-in-the-lnbits-app-store-page>.
  This will redirect you to the super admin page where you can install extensions. These extensions can then be enabled/disabled by
  any user.

  IMPORTANT NOTE ON EXTENSIONS:
  

  New versions of LNbits now have all extensions removed by default. To install extensions, you need
  to visit your super admin page and install them from there. To do this, open your LNbits app
  and replace the umbrel.local:3007 URL with umbrel.local:3007/uuidv4/<your-unique-password-shown-in-the-lnbits-app-store-page>.
  This will redirect you to the super admin page where you can install extensions. These extensions can then be enabled/disabled by
  any user.
